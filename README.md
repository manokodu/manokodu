I'm sharing my code for allowing customizable skins for fully functional audio players. I was unable to find much of anything still working from the early internet days.
Everything I could find is too modern, basic, soulless, uninspiring, empty. I figure I'll just make it myself and make it endearing. I am sharing it because code belongs 
to everyone, and surely someone would snatch up the code anyway. I recommend only editing image and color values, and follow the guide for changing more than that. 
My skills only take me this far but at least it is something that can bring joy and a special widget for personal websites. 
It's free for use, but corporations can duck right off.

                                                                              Thanks!!
